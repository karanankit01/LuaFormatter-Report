## Work Done
I finished the implementation of the feature request of setting configuration flags from the command line. I am working on the unit test of the feature. I also looked at the modification of **HACKING.md** and revised its structure. Also, I am working on the documentation of the args configuration feature. I will finish the documentation part and create PR for it by today.

## Doubts
I had some questions for the unit tests the args config feature. I go through some online materials and sources. I also studied the existing unit tests for some args projects to deal with it and started to program for it.

## Further Plans
Next week I will complete the unit test for this feature. After the review of the unit tests, I will improve and add more cases if required in it. After that, I will start working on further tasks in the Project.
