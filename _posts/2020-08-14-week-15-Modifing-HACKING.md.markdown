## Work Done
I have submitted the conflicting validators along with the test case in the same PR. I also updated the HACKING.md documentation with validators implementation. I am going through the final modification of the complete **HACKING.md**. I will submit this by tomorrow.

## Further Plans
Next week, I will start documenting the work submission report of the project and host it on the webpage. After completion of this project, I will start going through the issue to implement the enhancement features.
