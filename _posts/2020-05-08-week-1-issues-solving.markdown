## Work Done
I took a look at the some open as well as some close Github issues and tried to implement a fix for `issue#98` by adding a **column_table_limit feature**. I also updated the test_config for the fix of `issue#61`. I also went through the `issues#77` and started reading some material to understand the ambiguity for the semicolon in Lua grammar.
I have gone through some issues like `issue#60`, in which I think all things are fine and it can be closed.

## Doubts
I had some questions for some bug issues, which I am sorting right now with discussion with my mentor.

## Further Plans
Next week I plan to go through some more issues and understand the codebase by fixing it. Also, I will go through some old issues which can be closed. Next week, I will look into all aspects of each feature and be ready to be in the position to start planning for the way coming projects to be done.
