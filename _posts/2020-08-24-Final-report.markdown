## Further Work (After GSoC)

## Words of Thanks
I would like to thank my mentor for his continuous guidance throughout the summer and giving me the best experience of my life. The motivation and guidance I got from him will definitely help me in the days to come.  

Time flew and brought us close to the end. However, the best things deserve to be a special part of our life and LabLua had already made its place in my heart long back. Loads of ðŸ’– to my LabLua family.  

We will keep improving the user as well as developer experience in the coming days. Cheers to a new beginning.âœŒ
