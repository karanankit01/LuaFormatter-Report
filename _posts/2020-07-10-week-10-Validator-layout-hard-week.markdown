## Work Done
This week is a bit hard for me. I couldn’t code much due to my bad health and ongoing treatment. I went through some documentation and tutorials to improve my documentation skills. I also discuss the layout of the task implementation. I started to write the first set of code as well.

## Doubts
I had some queries related to mapping with lambda expressions as I haven’t used it earlier. So, I read some online resources for it and write some general code like comparators.

## Further Plans
Next week, I will do the task implementation. Along with the task, I will continue the documentation practice to improve my skills.
