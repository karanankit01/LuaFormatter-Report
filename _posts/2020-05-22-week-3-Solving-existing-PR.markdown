## Work Done
I took a look at some open Github issues and pull requests and tried to sort the issues. I also made the correct implementation of the align parameter for false config. Also, I made a workflow Report of the codebase.It contains the details of file execution and features implementation.I will make it as a markdown and create a PR by tomorrow.

## Doubts
I had some questions for the project workflow which was discussed and started in a new way. I also had some questions for some feature implementation which I get sorted from study online resources.

## Further Plans
Next week I will try to implement the feature which was assigned to me in `issue#110`. I will go through the details of this feature and then discuss its implementation to program it. After its completion, I will do the part which I will be assigned to go ahead with the project.
