## Work Done
I looked at the modification of HACKING.md and revised its structure. I went through the codebase once again and also try to look at how the program validates the Configuration lazily

## Further Plans
Almost the HACKING.md is done. So Next week I will start to work on the next task as directed and work on Configuration Validation.
