## Work Done
I have completed the sample codes for the library which I am going to use in the task. I also made a list of the inconsistencies which we have to deal with. I read some online materials for the `std: optional` to implement the task. I also start working on the first set of the code of this task which I will submit and take review by today.

## Further Plans
Next week, I will try to complete the implementation of the task. After review of all sets of codes in this task, I will start working on its test cases and documentation.
