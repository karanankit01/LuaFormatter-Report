## Work Done
I took a look at some open Github issues with labels enhancement like `issue#26` and `issue#98`. I updated the relative relation of **column_table_limit** with **column_limit**. Also, I come up with an approach to deal with `issue#26` and discuss it in detail. Unfortunately, I havenâ€™t made any fixes till now. At the same time, I am also looking into the bug `issue#85` and `issue#104`. I understand the codebase in a better way now.

## Doubts
I had some questions for the enhancement approach for some features, which I am discussing and also going through ANTLR APIs to deal with.

## Further Plans
Next week I plan to go through issues and fix them that I have mentioned above. On the parallel hand, I will start looking into the GSoC project i.e, where to start on and what approach we should follow. I will discuss it with my mentors to have a good start in the coding period. I would also go through some research or topics which would be required in the projects which would be suggested by them after discussing the approach of the project.
