## Work Done
I have submitted a set of codes for the configuration validator. I have gone through various documentation and implemented the basic layout of the validator. I received the review for the first set. I will do the suggested fix to the PR and submit by today.

## Doubts
I had some queries related to any_cast and YAML parser. After reading some blogs and information given by my mentor, it was solved.

## Further Plans
Next week, After fixing the suggested changes, I will submit the test case for it. I will add further inconsistencies validators like conflicting values. Meanwhile, I will continue the documentation practice to improve my skills(I am trying to write some technical blogs in free time for it).
