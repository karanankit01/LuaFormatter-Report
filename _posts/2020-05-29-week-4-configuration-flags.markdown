## Work Done
I took a look at an issue that has the feature request of setting configuration flags from the command line. I tried to implement it in `PR#113`. I also look at the modification of **HACKING.md** and revised its structure.


## Doubts
I had some questions for implementing the feature request which I discussed and read some materials from online sources to deal with it. I also read about taking argument flags.

## Further Plans
Next week I will look into the further modification and structure of **HACKING.md**. After the review of the new feature implementation, I will work on making a test case of the feature. Also, I will start working on further tasks in the Project.
