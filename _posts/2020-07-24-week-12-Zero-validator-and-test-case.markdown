title:  "Week 12 : Zero Validators and Test case build up"

## Work Done
I have submitted the test case of the validator. I will do the suggested fix to the PR along with adding a separate validator for 0s configuration value and submit by today.

## Doubts
I had some queries related to the test case build-up. After reading some documentation and links given by you, it cleared by doubt and I learned some new use cases.

## Further Plans
Next week, I will submit another validator like conflicting values. I will also add test cases to it. After completion of this task, I will follow up with the further instructions given to me to proceed.
