title:  "Week 13 : Initial set of Conflicting Validators"

## Work Done
Initial sets of validators have been submitted and reviewed completely. Now for the next set of validators, I discussed the approach and layout. I have done a part of it too. I will submit it in the new PR after the first set of Validators get merged.

## Doubts
I had some queries related to the approach but I figured it out by logical operators.

## Further Plans
Next week, I will submit the conflicting validators and its test case . After completion of this task, I will add the documentation in the HACKING.md.
