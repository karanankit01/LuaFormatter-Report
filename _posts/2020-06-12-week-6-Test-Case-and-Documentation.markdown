## Work Done
I finished the implementation of the unit test for the feature of setting configuration flags from the command line. I also finished the documentation part for the same. I also looked at the modification of HACKING.md and revised its structure. Also, I look at some documentation to write good documentation. I am working on the revised structure and  I will finish the HACKING.md and get the review to create PR for it by tomorrow.

## Doubts
I had some issues with the documentation part which I sort out by gong through various documentations of the codebase.

## Further Plans
Next week I will complete the HACKING.md at the beginning itself and start working on the next task. I will start to look at how the program validates the Configuration lazily and discuss further to start working on it.
