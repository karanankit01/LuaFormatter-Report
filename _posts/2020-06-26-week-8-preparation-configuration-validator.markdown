## Work Done
I started the new task of configuration validation. I read some online materials for the lambda expressions and use cases for `std:optional` to implement the task. I prepared the list of inconsistencies that can be occured in the configuration and figured out the way to deal with it by discussing with the mentor.

## Doubts
I had some queries related to the `std:optional` uses. I am figuring out the way to implement it in a better way.

## Further Plans
Next week, I will try to implement the above task. Also next week, I will be ready for the first evaluation. After completion of the task I will start working on its test cases and documentation.
